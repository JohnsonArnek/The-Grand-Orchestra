1. To get the latest version, click the green button that says "Code" and click "Download ZIP".

2. Go to the mod folder in your Victoria 2 install directory.
  * If you got the Steam version on Windows this will look something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2/mod
  * If you got a non-Steam version on Windows it might be something like C:/Program Files (x86)/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 2/mod

3. From the ZIP move everything into the mod folder.

Start the game, select "TGC - The Grand Combination" and "TGO - The Grand Orchestra".

You can use the GitHub Desktop application. This is slightly more complicated but preferable since you will be able to easily update the mod for new music without downloading everything again. For instructions on this go to the #install-instructions channel on the Discord.
